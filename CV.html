        <p>My name is <strong>Shveika Mykhailo</strong>. I was born 05.10.1990 in Chernivtsi. I have been working as content-manager during 5 years. 
        I have two higher education (economic and engineering), which I received in the period from 2007 to 2012. I speak English (B2) and French (A1). In 2016, I completed thematic training courses on landscaping from Sergiy Troubadour.</p>
        <p>Major achievements include working with well-known law firm Lawrence Graham & Co Wragge. In 2018, as a hobby, I started an auto-detailing project, which allowed me to gain the necessary knowledge in the field of content for social networks (the number of Instagram subscribers reached 20 thousand people).</p>
